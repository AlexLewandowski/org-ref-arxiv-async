  Abstract = "Abstract We performed a series of density functional
                  theory calculations of dissociative oxygen
                  adsorption on fcc metals and their corresponding
                  rocksalt monoxides to elucidate the relationship
                  between the oxide electronic structure and its
                  corresponding reactivity. We decomposed the
                  dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on an oxide
                  surface into a sum of the adsorption energy on the
                  metal and a change in adsorption energy caused by
                  both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We were
                  able to identify the key features of the electronic
                  structure that explains the trends in adsorption
                  energies on 3d transition metal monoxide surfaces. ",
