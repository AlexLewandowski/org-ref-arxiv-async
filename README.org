#+TITLE: org-ref: citations, cross-references, indexes, glossaries and bibtex utilities for org-mode

See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zya8SfmCtFA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyvpSVl4_dg for examples of org-ref in action.

[[./org-ref.org]] contains all documentation and installation instructions.

[[./doi-utils.org]] contains functions for downloading bibtex entries from  a DOI, and redefines the org-mode doi link so it has more functionality. 

[[./jmax-bibtex.el]] contains some utility functions:

1. jmax-bibtex runs a menu command with actions to run on a bibtex entry including looking up the doi for the entry in a variety of places, e.g. web of science related/citing articles, Google Scholar, Pubmed, and crossref, or opening a PDF associated with the entry.

2. Bind M-n/M-p to next/previous bibtex entry.

3. Sentence/title casing the title of a bibtex entry

4. Function to replace non-ascii characters in bibtex entries

5. Functions to replace journal names with @string entries, and corresponding short/long names.

To install this, add the org-ref repo directory to your load-path, and 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path-to-org-ref")
(require 'jmax-bibtex)
#+END_SRC
